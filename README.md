## Overview

This is a solution to the [Fylo landing page with two column layout challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-landing-page-with-two-column-layout-5ca5ef041e82137ec91a50f5).

### The challenge

The challenge was to build a responsive page from a figma design (https://www.figma.com/file/Wwx6Vxs5539DW0xpB8mOZ2/fylo-landing-page-with-two-column-layout?node-id=0%3A122&t=G7WKQXvV9VIy5obE-0) with different hover states for interactive elements and with a little bit of JavaScript for validating an email address.

- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt two different ways of executing click events in JavaScript: first, the "onclick" style right from the HTML page, second the click "eventListner" from JavaScript file.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on JavaScript in future projects and make the pages that I build more interactive.

### Useful resources

- [HTML Button onclick - JavaScript Click Event Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/html-button-onclick-javascript-click-event-tutorial/) - This helped me understand the ways of executing click events in JavaScript.
- [How to Do an Email Validation in JavaScript?](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/javascript-tutorial/email-validation-in-javascript) - I used this article in order to see how email validation works in JavaScript.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my mentor Paata Gharibashvili for helping me overcome the challenges that I have faced while working through this project.
